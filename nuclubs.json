Through our partnership with other non-profit organizations in Evanston, such as Our Place and Transition House, we also organize weekly Community Music Choir on a weekday for other community members with or without special needs to sing together. At the end of each quarter, we put on a concert for our students, their families, and volunteers to celebrate their hard work and talents. Through our Saturday Ensemble and Community Music Choir programs, we hope to provide our students, regardless of their cognitive abilities or age, a safe space to make music. AMASE volunteers are also dedicated to promote awareness and acceptance of neurodiversity to the greater campus community through various campaigns, fundraisers, and collaborations with other student organizations with similar interests.</p>\r\n<p>For more information about volunteering, please visit our <a href=\"http://nuamase.weebly.com/\"> website</a>&nbsp;or email us at amase@u.northwestern.edu.</p>\r\n<p>To learn more about our students and get a taste of what we do, please follow us on social media--we keep active <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NUAMASE/\">Facebook </a>and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nu.amase/\"> Instagram</a> accounts that documents our lovely students' weekly progress.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "Description": "<p>Alpha Psi Lambda National, Inc. is&nbsp;a Co-educational Fraternity geared towards the goals of Latino students on university campuses. As the fastest-growing minority in this country, it is becoming more important that the Latino community continues their education. This trend has also brought with it a need for cultural awareness, cultural identity, and cross-cultural understanding. As a result, there is an increased need for Alpha Psi Lambda for which we try to assist in the identity of our culture. This trend has been demonstrated by the growth of our Fraternity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While we are a Latino interest Fraternity, Alpha Psi Lambda has welcomed people from a broad spectrum of cultures across the globe.&nbsp;Alpha Psi Lambda stands as one family united.&nbsp;Our strength lies in our ability to focus on our culture while appreciating the diversity of others.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Latino culture is very strongly rooted in family and support, which allows Alpha Psi Lambda to provide those same roots to our Fraternity. Alpha Psi Lambda, to its members, is more than just a Fraternity. It creates that true family support, brotherhood, and sisterhood, at a time in a student's life when it is most important.&nbsp;Our membership prides itself on the values of&nbsp;Familia, Culture, Academics, Service, and Leadership.</p>",

Students participating in class trips take a peer-led, for-credit course taught by seasoned ASB veterans before heading out to work with the social issue they just spent the previous quarter learning about. These classes are a great way to deepen your learning about a social issue near to your heart, and also meet wonderful, passionate peers. For winter break class trips, the class takes place during the fall quarter. For spring break class trips, the classes take place during winter quarter. All these fantastic classes are also pass/fail!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You can get involved with ASB in several ways. Join our listserv to receive applications for upcoming trips by sending a request to asb@u.northwestern.edu.

It started out as an umbrella organization for all of the Asian/Asian American student groups to coordinate and guide their different activities. In 1992, the AAAB gained A-status from the Northwestern&rsquo;s Associated Student Government. The organization began to make headlines in 1995 when APAC organized a successful hunger strike fighting for the creation of an Asian American Studies Program. The incident garnered public support from universities all over the country and has served to inspire a new generation of young Asian Americans. In 2003, AAAB officially changed its name to The Asian Pacific American Coalition (APAC). The new name was intended to be more inclusive and reflective of the diverse and heterogeneous mix of Asian America. Along with the name change, APAC remade its constitution and redefined its mission statement towards a more holistic outlook, making commitments to community building by addressing political, cultural, and social issues of Asian America both within our own community and with the rest of NU&rsquo;s population through various programs and events. In the past, APAC has hosted events such as Asian American History Month, a screening of Better Luck Tomorrow with cast and director Justin Lin, the annual Mr. PanAsia, Powderpuff football, Espresso Expressions, and speakers such as actor George Takei, comedian Margaret Cho, music video director Joseph Kahn, SuChin Pak of MTV, Japanese Breakfast, and Alok Vaid-Menon.</div>\r\n<div class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x__2cuy x_x_x_x_x_x__3dgx x_x_x_x_x_x__2vxa\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x__2cuy x_x_x_x_x_x__3dgx x_x_x_x_x_x__2vxa\">APAC strives to achieve the following:</div>\r\n<ul class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x__5a_q x_x_x_x_x_x__5yj1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<li class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x__2cuy x_x_x_x_x_x__509q x_x_x_x_x_x__2vxa\">Commit to accessibility and inclusion, especially with regard to non-East Asian communities</li>\r\n<li class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x__2cuy x_x_x_x_x_x__509q x_x_x_x_x_x__2vxa\">Recognize differences in experience within the umbrella of Asian, Asian American, and Pacific Islander peoples, as well as the experiences of multiracial peoples</li>\r\n<li class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x__2cuy x_x_x_x_x_x__509q x_x_x_x_x_x__2vxa\">Engage and mobilize the student community through activism and advocacy</li>\r\n<li class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x__2cuy x_x_x_x_x_x__509q x_x_x_x_x_x__2vxa\">Undertake intersectional grassroots activism and advocacy in the larger Northwestern community, Evanston, and Chicago</li>\r\n<li class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x__2cuy x_x_x_x_x_x__509q x_x_x_x_x_x__2vxa\">Foster collective healing from historical, intergenerational, and individual trauma</li>\r\n<li class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x__2cuy x_x_x_x_x_x__509q x_x_x_x_x_x__2vxa\">Empower individuals with marginalized identities</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If you are interested in joining APAC, interest forms are open near the beginning of every quarter -- keep an eye out on the FB page or send us an email at apac@u.northwestern.edu for updates!</p>",

    "Description": "<p>Christian Science is a protestant denomination founded by Mary Baker Eddy in 1879. The church's mission is to \"reinstate primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing.\" We believe that everybody can heal the way Jesus healed, because God's universal laws can be applied with scientific certainty to any situation. For this reason, we refer to ourselves as Christian Scientists. Christian Science is wholly based on the Bible and the teachings of Christ Jesus, who declared that \"He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also.\" Jesus' bold declaration was a call to action that we answer every day through our practice of Christian Science. While people are occasionally confused about what Christian Science is, Christian Science is not a cult, not an eastern religion, a new age practice, faith healing, or Scientology. Instead, Christian Science is a thoroughly Christian faith that seeks to uplift all of humanity by unlocking the healing power of the Christ- which is as present and powerful now as it was 2,000 years ago.&nbsp;</p>",

First, the world still under invests in girls. Even though a lot of progress has been made in terms of providing access to education for girls, still, there have been groups of girls that have been left behind in the broad rises to access to education. These girls are typically in the most difficult to reach places -- think indigenous, rural, communities, whose intersectionality in terms of broad societal marginalization has excluded them from big waves and progress towards universal access to education. This means that still, the most vulnerable girls are often the first ones to miss out on educations when families have to make hard decisions about who to send to school.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each project is tailored to the specific school and community; we take into consideration their needs rather than imposing our own agenda. Projects look different in each place. Some have focused on access like building dorms in Kenya, expanding or increasing quality of education like building computer labs in Peru or A-level classrooms in Tanzania</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a video of the perfect example of what we try to power through our partnerships.

Real life.</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Northwestern Cru is a community where the gospel captures hearts, transforms lives, impacts the world and launches men and women into a lifelong adventure with Jesus Christ. We&rsquo;re glad you&rsquo;re here. In short, we are about students becoming world changers. God has you in one of the most exciting places of your life&mdash;the campus. Unlike any other place (or likely any other time in your life) the world is literally all around you. Take a look around you, I&rsquo;m willing to bet that within a few minutes of where you&rsquo;re sitting right now you can meet someone from a different country, a different culture, and a different family setting than your own. And you may not be able to see it right now, but within a number of years these very people that you are sitting around in class and living next to right now in your dorm, house or apartment building will be people who give shape to the culture, the community, the nation and the world! The campus is a pretty amazing place!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, amidst this amazing setting we see that God is doing something big on the campus. Have you ever been confused about God? Have you ever felt disconnected from Him? Have you ever wondered if he was really real at all? Or maybe you believe that He is there, but you just don&rsquo;t feel close to Him or you are trying to figure out this faith thing. Well, our experience tells us that these are common questions for today&rsquo;s generation&mdash;and for those who wonder, more are discovering something real and fresh in a personal relationship with God! In fact if you&rsquo;ve ever wondered some of these things,take a few minutes now and email one of us. We may not have all the answers but would love to hear your story.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Cru is a movement of people across the globe that are growing in and helping others grow in a personal relationship with God&ndash;one filled with increasing purpose, hope, honesty, &amp; intimacy. So why did you come to college? What will you leave with? What&rsquo;s your purpose in life? We hope that you&rsquo;ll find us, find God, and find the adventure that is waiting for you!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">If you are curious about this relationship with God, or want to learn more about Christianity a great resource is </span><a href=\"http://everystudent.com/features/gettingconnected.html\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Knowing God Personally</span></span></span></a><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> from </span><a href=\"http://groups.northwestern.edu/crusade/cru/about/everystudent.com\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">EveryStudent.com</span></span></span></a></p>",

While each individual sector is important, Girl Up NU believes that together, all three categories have the potential to create the most effective change.<br /><br />Moreover, because these issues are oceans away from Northwestern University, Girl Up NU utilizes a unique community development model in order to stay connected to its mission in a hands-on way. Examples of community engagement that Girl Up NU practices include inviting girls from RefugeeOne to campus and inviting Girl Scout troupes to learn about sustainability, culminating with an educational summit for middle school girls at Northwestern University in the spring.

There, they collaborate with Adonai&nbsp;Executive Directors Aloysious and Abby Luswata along with members of the local community on sustainable, capacity building&nbsp;projects. Previous projects included the medical centre, safe water project, an electronic data system for their records, and&nbsp;a community needs assessment on existing&nbsp;health infrastructures, water and sanitation, and reusable energy needs of the community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Back on campus, we hold weekly global health themed meetings to discuss current issues&nbsp;and allow our members to think critically in a low-stress, safe environment. Our mission is to&nbsp;create a sustainable impact on the health of our partner community as well as inspire and train&nbsp;the next generation of global health leaders. If you are interested in joining our community,&nbsp;recruitment is early Fall Quarter.

In the last decade, the need for a dedicated group targeting the interests of graduate women led to the establishment of GradSWE in 2012. As interest continued to grow, GradSWE formed an executive board of 8-10 people to coordinate social, professional development, and mentoring events to meet the needs of the graduate women community. GradSWE includes female and male graduate students across all STEM disciplines at NU who advocate for the participation and retention of women in STEM at all levels. We organize events such as quarterly lunch discussions and co-host networking events and monthly coffee hours to build support networks and community among graduate women and advocates. Moreover, benefiting from our position in the broader SWE network, we leverage our connections with professional organizations (SWE and Association for Women in Science) in Chicago and NU SWE undergraduates to encourage mentorship and networking between women at all careers stages.</span></p>",

Throughout the year, we hold events including open mics and writing workshops.</p>",

Through our efforts, we also hope to raise the awareness of hospice and palliative care, as well as hospice volunteering, at Northwestern and connect the student body to the surrounding community in a positive way.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our primary goal is to see that all hospice patients in the Northwestern area get a friendly face if they want one. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, we want HPCC to be a win-win-win for the hospices we connect with, the students who are willing to generously give their time, and the hospice patients who truly benefit from having regular visits. To be Medicare-certified, hospices are required to have volunteer hours comprise at least 5% of their total number of patient care hours. Having a steady stream of volunteers also allows hospices to always provide a hospice patient with their own volunteer, improving the level of care these hospices can provide. From our members' perspectives, each student will be closely involved with their own patient(s). From these experiences, the student will learn both the healthcare responsibilities of being a team's official \"Patient Care Hospice Volunteer\" and lessons from a human being who naturally becomes a close friend. Regular club meetings will provide support and additional learning opportunities for the students: basic check-ins to make sure students are not stressing themselves out in their kind-hearted efforts, discussions on how they can best serve their patients, inviting guest speakers from the hospices to talk about intriguing and difficult issues in health care, and coverage of transportation costs through ASG funding if applicable.</span></p>",

Our weekly meeting is called Family Night. It is an opportunity&nbsp;for students to worship God in a variety of ways - Through song, prayer, and studying the Bible together. Family Nights are on Friday at 7:00 p.m in the Black House (1914 Sheridan). Some of our other events include conferences in the Fall, Winter, and Summer. These conferences&nbsp;offer students and staff the opportunity to step away from the demands of campus&nbsp;life and strengthen their connection&nbsp;with God, themselves, and eachother while gaining biblical truth. One of our favorite campus outreach events is \"Free Hugs &amp; Free Prayer.\" Each Spring we stand on Sheridan to offer encouragement to our brothers and sisters on campus and share God's love through hugs, prayer, and scriptures.</p>",

NUii's chief objective is to promote and spread awareness of religious pluralism by increasing constructive communication between religiously diverse peers within the Northwestern community. This insists upon an appreciation of individual differences and shared values.</p>\r\n<p>Therefore, on the inter-organizational level, NUii serves as a nexus for campus religious groups to coordinate cosponsored programming. In addition, we welcome people of all types of backgrounds, including those who claim a faith and those who do not.</p>\r\n<p>We hold weekly hour-long meetings. Each meeting starts off with a free dinner. Afterwards, we introduce our discussion topic, guest speakers, or event theme and have an evening filled with lasting conversations and challenging questions.</p>",

The fall season begins in September and runs to the end of October. The spring season begins in late March and extends to early May.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #888888;\"><strong>Games</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #888888;\">We typically play anywhere between 4-6 games in the fall against teams in the Chicago-land area. The bulk of our schedule is in the spring which includes approximately 10-12 games during the regular season and a year-end bracket style tournament to determine the GLLL champions. We play all other teams in the &ldquo;Chicago Division&rdquo; of the GLLL: Northern Illinois, Western Illinois, University of Chicago, Lake Forest College, and Loyola University. We also play teams in the Central (e.g. University of Wisconsin &ndash; Madison) and Eastern (e.g. Notre Dame, School Craft) division during the regular season. We will occasionally travel on away games for regular season competition and the year-end tournament which is hosted on a rotating basis.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #888888;\"><strong>Practices</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #888888;\">In the fall, we are scheduled to practice three times a week, as well as opportunities for group fitness. We stress the importance of coming to practice, so please try to arrange your class schedule around practice times. Practice times will be in the evenings usually from either 7-9pm or 8-10pm.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #888888;\">In the winter, we reserve a two hour block in the University&rsquo;s indoor turf facility. The format for this time block is more flexible that in the fall and spring. At times, we practice. Other times we devote the time to the development of specific skills and non-contact drills.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #888888;\">In the spring, we are scheduled to practice two times a week, reserving the third and possibly fourth day of activity for competition. Attending practices in the spring is integral to success during competition. We encourage 100% participation in practice and other events in the spring. Practice times will be in the evenings usually from either 7-9pm or 8-10pm.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #888888;\">*Please note that the practice schedule may change according to our allocated field space and time each season.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #888888;\"><strong>Dues</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #888888;\">All members are required to pay club dues, which are approximately $225. This is necessary to cover the league fees, referee fees, travel costs, apparel, and social events. The apparel provided by the Club for its members is: 1 reversible jersey, 1 pairs of shorts, and additional apparel will be made available trough the team shop (1 tee, 1 sweatshirt, and 1 pair of sweatpants). Members have an opportunity to order protective equipment (e.g. helmet, gloves) through the club at a discounted rate.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #888888;\"><strong>Tryouts</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #888888;\">Practice will begin at the end of New Student week. We encourage players with any previous playing experience to join and truly welcome all to join. A percentage of the membership has not played lacrosse before arriving to Northwestern campus. In addition to playing lacrosse, the team arranges outings and gatherings in order to build a strong community for the players.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #888888;\">If you have any questions about the Men&rsquo;s Lacrosse Club, please contact us at <span style=\"color: #888888;\">coletingley2022@u.northwestern.edu</span>.</span></p>",

Our roster is brimming with talent, including former Varsity athletes and high school standouts, and we are exceptionally proud of the club's professionalism and level of play. In the past, our club finished twice in the Top 10 in the nation, we are extremely excited to continue to build on the club's recent successes.</p>\r\n<p>Our fall season consists of 10 regular season games against other teams in the Western division of the Midwest conference. Pending qualification, the Midwest regional tournament takes place in late October, and the national tournament takes place in mid-November. With practices two times a week and games on the weekend, the season is fast-paced and demands a sizable commitment, but does not conflict with class time.</p>\r\n<p>The informal winter season consists of one&nbsp;practice a week at the University's state-of-the-art indoor sports facility, including participation in an indoor league that plays once a week in Chicago. Our spring season, though less formal than the fall season, generally consists of about 8 games, including a weekend away for a tournament--the past two trips have been to Ohio State and Michigan State.</p>\r\n<p>THIS YEAR, TRYOUTS WILL BE SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 22TH AND MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 23RD FROM 9 - 11 AM BOTH DAYS. THEY WILL BE LOCATED ON LONG FIELD, WHICH IS DIRECTLY NORTH OF ELDER. PLEASE SHOW UP ABOUT 30 MINUTES EARLY TO WARM UP AND BRING BOTH A LIGHT AND DARK SHIRT. Additional tryouts will occur depending on if a player is asked to return the following day. The roster tends to come in at around twenty-five to thirty athletes, and club members will be expected to pay a specified amount in team dues at the beginning of the season.</p>\r\n<p>We practice and play our home matches at the fantastic Lakeside Field on the shore of Lake Michigan, and travel within the region to all of our away matches.</p>\r\n<p>Although we are committed to success on the pitch, the very fabric of NU Men's Club Soccer is our committment to commraderie. Playing for the club is an awesome opportunity to continue to play competitive soccer, and provides a close-knit community for incoming students at the beginning of the academic year.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

    "Description": "<p><strong>Formula SAE</strong></p>\r\n<p>Formula SAE (FSAE) is an intercollegiate engineering design competition organized by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), where student teams design, build, and race formula-style cars. FSAE began in the USA in 1978, and now includes hundreds of international teams that compete in eight competitions around the world.</p>\r\n<p>The FSAE series is internationally regarded as one of the most rigorous collegiate design competitions. Each year, teams spend 8 to 12 months preparing for competition.</p>\r\n<p>The concept of the competition is for students to design, build, and race a prototype formula-style vehicle. The prototype is marketed towards the non-professional, weekend autocross racer. It must be high-performance, low cost, easy to maintain, and suitable for manufacture at 1000 units per year. Students manage all aspects of the project like a small business, from the technical design to the management of an interdisciplinary team.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Engineering</strong></p>\r\n<p>Teams have overwhelming freedom in the design of their cars. This is evident in the variety and ingenuity presented at each competition. Technical restrictions only exist to ensure safety, and do not limit creativity. Students engage a panel of industry judges to defend their design decisions with supporting analysis. Student drivers compete against the clock in a series of driving events to demonstrate real-world performance of their vehicles.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Business and Marketing</strong></p>\r\n<p>Building a racing car is not all engineering. Complex projects require strong leaders and a cooperative environment to succeed. In addition to managing the project, students must present a business case to a prospective manufacturer as well as a detailed manufacturing and cost analysis, showing complete understanding of what it takes to bring a product to market.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspective</strong></p>\r\n<p>FSAE converts classroom knowledge to real world experience. Involvement in the complete design process is a unique educational opportunity.</p>",

Our mission is to unite the Northwestern, Evanston, and Greater Chicagoland communities through philanthropic fundraising, service, and education. A year-long effort culminating in a 30-hour dance marathon, NUDM strives to create an inclusive and enriching environment for the NUDM student body, our rotating primary beneficiary, and our longstanding secondary beneficiary, the Evanston Community Foundation (ECF). Since 1975, NUDM has raised more than $20 million for more than 35 different charitable organizations.</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>Our History</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1975, Northwestern University Dance Marathon, the philanthropic child of Alpha Tau Omega fraternity and the Associated Student Government, was born on the Northwestern University Evanston campus. It was initially called the &ldquo;Dance to Give Them a Chance&rdquo; marathon, and it benefited the American Epilepsy Foundation and the Arc. Fifteen couples made it through the 52-hour marathon, raising $9,100 at Blomquist Memorial Gymnasium.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NUDM is now one of the world&rsquo;s largest collegiate philanthropies! Last year, NUDM raised $674,325 for Compass to Care &ndash; which strives to eliminate the monetary burden of traveling to treatment for families with a child who is ill &ndash; and the Evanston Community Foundation &ndash; which funds a variety of local grants to deserving organizations with the goal of helping Evanston thrive.</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>Where We Are Now</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, NUDM is thrilled to partner with Chicago Youth Programs (CYP). CYP is a nonprofit organization striving to improve the life opportunities and health of youth in low-income neighborhoods, primarily on the south and west sides of Chicago, through long-term academic, emotional and mental support. CYP gives their participants the tools for self-regulation, empathy and communication, while also enriching their passions through socializing programs in arts and culture. This year, NUDM and CYP are working together to help Chicago&rsquo;s youth overcome systemic inequities and obtain the higher education necessary to break the cycle of poverty.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more information, see</span><a href=\"https://nudm.org\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nudm.org</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>",

The Northwestern sailing team attends upwards of 25 events each year. Practice is held in the fall and spring Monday thru Thursday from 3-6 out of the NU boathouse. Team members are asked to attend practice at least twice a week. Single-Handed and Sloop Nationals occur in the fall while Co-ed, Women's, and Team Race Nationals are held in the spring.</p>\r\n<p><strong>League Affiliation:</strong></p>\r\n<p>College sailing features over 200 schools and is governed by the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association (ICSA). The ICSA is broken down into seven regional districts, with the Midwest Collegiate Sailing Association, of which Northwestern is a member, stretching from Minnesota to Ohio.</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>Club Dues:</strong></p>\r\n<p>200 dollars per year. Team members are also required to purchase proper sailing gear their first year.</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>Tryout Schedule:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Try outs are held each fall.</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>Practice Locations:</strong></p>\r\n<p>NU Sailing Center, located on south beach which features a fleet of 12 420's and 8 lasers.</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>Competition Locations:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Schools all over the country, however most events are in the Midwest. Frequent locations are Wisconsin, Minnesota, Ohio State, and Michigan, however this past year we attended events in Seattle, Larchmont, and Dallas.</p>",

Inspired by the table tennis talent and potential at Northwestern, a group of students came together to form a club to encourage and foster the skills and interests of table tennis enthusiasts around campus. Also, we seek to provide opportunities for students to compete in regional and national tournaments. Now, the club holds weekly practices and organizes local and regional tournaments throughout the year, and will be&nbsp;travelling to various locations to compete with other colleges.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Philosophy </strong></p>\r\n<p>The club is open to all skill levels from those never having held a ping pong paddle before to those who have been trained by coaches for many years. We encourage all those who have interest in the sport to come join us at our practices. Attendance is not mandatory; members can come and go as they please.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>About the Club </strong></p>\r\n<p>We have around 15-20&nbsp;regular members attending our weekly meetings. We have four tables, thanks to the great support of Norris and the Sports Club Department. We also provide table tennis balls and paddles for those who do not own one.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Practice Schedule </strong></p>\r\n<p>Our practices are typically held Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday evenings from 8-10 pm at SPAC, in the second floor tennis court bleachers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Email reminders will be sent weekly. To receive these reminders or hear more weekly updates of the club, please subscribe to the listserv by employing the following steps:</p>\r\n<p>1) Send e-mail to listserv@listserv.it.northwestern.edu without any subject line. <br />2) Type the following command in the message: <br /><br />SUBSCRIBE NUTableTennis Firstname Lastname</p>\r\n<p><em>(ex.

We often have optional pick-up games throughout the year. <br /><br /><strong>Competition Schedule:</strong></p>\r\n<p>FALL: We play the majority of our games in the fall quarter, competing against several Chicago community and Division III colleges. We also play the club teams from other Big 10 and Division I schools from the Midwest. We also attend tournaments in the Midwest.</p>\r\n<p>WINTER: We enter our team into the Frat-tastic, guy's IM (intramural) league (the co-ed league isn't competitive enough for us), play a few more games against community colleges and club teams, and we play in one/two more tournaments. The highlight of our season is the regional tournament held at the end of winter quarter. This is where we try desperately to make it to nationals, but always manage to get beat by the University of Illinois club team. Maybe next year.</p>\r\n<p>SPRING: We don't play any formal games in the spring, but we try to continue playing pick-up. Just to make sure we don't lose that jumpshot.&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>League affiliation:</strong> None <br /><br /><strong>Club Dues:</strong> $110/year (or $55/quarter)<br /><br /><strong>Try-outs:</strong> Try-outs are usually the first Sunday and Tuesday evenings after the start of classes. Look for us at the Activities Fair or check our Facebook page during the first week of classes to find out specific dates! <br /><br /><strong>Frequency:</strong> Practices are twice per week, and games usually start towards the end of October and continue at a rate of one to two per week until Thanksgiving. Games during winter quarter are less frequent--usually on weekends. When we play in the Chicago area, travel time to games varies typically between twenty minutes to an hour or so. When we play at tournaments like Southern Illinois or Indiana, we leave for the entire weekend and travel about five hours both ways. However, that is the farthest that we travel.</p>",

In partnership with communities, we exist to help young people achieve more positive and equitable health outcomes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Equity</strong></p>\r\n<p>We believe that all young people deserve equitable opportunities to learn about and act for their health. For our part in that work, we deliver a culturally appropriate, trauma-informed curriculum that focuses on the barriers facing the most marginalized youth. To do so, we address the effects of power and privilege in our work and strive to be anti-racist, anti-nationalist, anti-queerphobic, anti-transphobic, anti-sexist, anti-classist, and anti-ableist.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Agency</strong></p>\r\n<p>We believe in the potential of every young person. We work to empower young people to make active, informed choices about their health. In turn, we recognize the value each one of us brings to our work. We commit to making full use of our own agency as individuals and as an organization in service of our goals.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>\r\n<p>We rely on direct and honest exchange for all that we do. We value communication as essential to articulating our vision and goals, forming strong relationships, working through challenges, and learning from and with our young people and partners.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Impact</strong></p>\r\n<p>We know that achieving long-term success will require reflection, innovation, and sustained effort. To further our impact, we hold ourselves to meaningful and measurable outcomes, evaluate our successes and challenges openly, and act on what we learn.</p>\r\n<h3>History</h3>\r\n<p>In 1999, six Yale undergraduates began teaching health workshops in New Haven public schools in order to fill the gap left by an underfunded, understaffed district health program. In 2003, the founding members of the group established Peer Health Exchange to replicate this successful program in other communities with unmet health education needs. Since then, we have trained more than 8,500 college student volunteers to deliver effective health education to over 115,000 public high school students in New York City, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Washington, DC, seeing strong initial results.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

Even though our name says &ldquo;Public Affairs,&rdquo; the students who live here are diverse in their areas of study. While we have our fair share of SESP and Medill students, each of Northwestern&rsquo;s six schools is generously represented in PARC&rsquo;s student population, even McCormick (the walk to Tech from NMQ is really not that bad). Your fellow PARCers will help you grow both academically and personally. Not only will you learn from PARC&rsquo;s college staff and guest speakers; you will also learn from your fellow PARCers themselves. Students in PARC hold leadership positions in countless organizations on campus, whether for student-run publications, engineering societies, student government, and more. PARC fosters dialogue between students so that ideas can flow freely between us. At PARC you won&rsquo;t just find a dorm; you&rsquo;ll find a home.</p>",

Our sorority addresses this issue through leadership, outreach, individual, community interaction, and most importantly, the bonds of sisterhood. The sorority also promotes development among its members, the students and the faculty at each of the campuses we represent. In order to achieve this goal, we partake in political, social, educational, and cultural activities. Each effort improves our environment, and instills within our sisters experiences that will follow them long after they've graduated. Through a network of like-minded yet highly individualistic women, the sorority lends structure and support to sisters that share this Sigma vision. We believe the strength of our foundation derives from the unity of sisterhood, one that was proudly established years ago. In addition, we work in collaboration with other Greek and non-Greek organizations to provide services for the local communities and the community at large. It is through our various participation in these cultural events, educational workshops, and philanthropic support that we make a difference.

SJP believes that while the Palestinian people must ultimately be able to decide their future in Palestine, certain key principles, grounded in international law, human rights, and basic standards of justice, are fundamental to a just resolution of the plight of the Palestinians. These include the full decolonization of all illegally held Palestinian lands, the end of the Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem. Furthermore, we believe in a just and fair resolution to the Palestinian right of return and repatriation of Palestinian refugees, as well as an end to the Israeli system of discrimination against the indigenous Palestinian population. Just as SJP condemns the discrimination underlying the policies and laws of the state of Israel, SJP rejects and condemns any form of hatred or discrimination against any religious, racial, or ethnic group.

During the game, each player needs to logically come up with convincing speeches and reasonable deductions within a very short period of time.</p>\r\n<p><br />Many have found that they have become better at critical thinking and making impromptu speeches after participating. More importantly, they develop strong bonds among themselves while having great fun. This game is extremely popular among both undergraduate and graduate students (our first few trial events have attracted around 50 students each time). However, many students tend to stick to their own local groups and do not have the chance of meeting new players due to the lack of interaction between graduates and undergraduates. Also, it is very hard for them to find enough people each time. Our aim is to provide such<br />an opportunity to bring these excellent players together and help them meet new people, so they can share new strategies and improve their conversation and networking skills. Players of any experience level are welcome, and our members are ready and able to teach the game to any new players. We intend to host a weekly event for both undergraduates and graduates and participate in national tournaments (which are hosted sporadically).

Based on team interest, scheduling and finances, our goal is to finish each season with a trip to the NCVF National Tournament in early April. We practice twice a week on campus, in addition to participating in beach games and other opportunities when they arise. We pride ourselves on being a competitive squad, so we expect our level of play to reflect that every time we pick up a volleyball &ndash; in practices, tournaments, on the beach, and elsewhere. Being a part of the Women&rsquo;s Club Volleyball team is a commitment &ndash; we expect every member to attend each practice, tournament and meeting, unless academic or emergency circumstances apply.

The team holds two practices during the week and matches on weekends throughout the fall and spring. During the off-season, players continue skill development at indoor winter practices and work on conditioning and weight training individually.</p>\r\n<p>In past years, the team has traveled and competed internationally during Spring Break with the NU men's team. In 2002, the teams traveled to Barcelona, Andorra and Perpignan, and France.&nbsp; In 2006, the women's team traveled to Ireland, in 2008, to Germany, and in 2010, the Bahamas.&nbsp; In 2012, the team decided to stay in the Midwest and competed in the March Madness Tournament in Wayne, Nebraska, combining teams with the College of St. Benedict and St. John's Women.&nbsp; Competing with 85 teams nationally, Northwestern Women held their own, winning all games in their division.&nbsp; The tournament was completed with nights of camping, and a road trip full of bonding and ridiculousness.<br /><br />We do not hold tryouts, so anyone who wants to join the team is able to come out to practice and play. We usually have six or seven games each season, traveling to roughly half.&nbsp; For league games, travel is limited to the Chicagoland area, but we usually take one overnight trip to locations such as University of Michigan and Northern Illinois University to compete in the Tournament of Champions.&nbsp; Fall practices are held at Long Field, winter practices at Trienen's Hall, and spring practices are held on Lakeside Field.&nbsp; All home games are played at Long Field.</p>",
